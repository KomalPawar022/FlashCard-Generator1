## Installation

Prerequisites:

  Node.js and npm (or yarn): Ensure you have Node.js (version 14 or later) and npm (Node Package Manager) installed on your system. You can verify this by running node -v and npm -v in your terminal. If not installed, download them from the official Node.js website (https://nodejs.org/).

Project Setup:

    Create a new project directory:
        Open your terminal or command prompt and navigate to your desired workspace directory.
        Run the following command to create a new project folder named flashcard-generator:

   	mkdir flashcard-generator
        cd flashcard-generator
	
Initialize the project:
    Inside the project directory, initialize a new npm project using:
	npm init -y
    This creates a basic package.json file for your project.


Installation:

    Install dependencies:
        Run the following command to install all the required dependencies using npm:
	
	npm install react react-dom react-router-dom redux react-redux redux-toolkit react-pdf react-pdf-renderer @react-pdf/renderer @heroicons/react react-icons react-share react-web-share react-switch tailwindcss

	This will download and install all the necessary libraries and their dependencies into your project's node_modules folder.

Tailwind CSS Setup:
	Follow setup instructions for integrating it into your React project. Refer to the Tailwind CSS documentation (https://tailwindcss.com/docs/installation) for detailed guidance.
